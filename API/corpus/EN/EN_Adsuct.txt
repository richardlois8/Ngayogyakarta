Adisutjipto (or Adisucipto) Airport (Indonesian: Bandar Udara Adisutjipto) (IATA: JOG, ICAO: WAHH) is an airport serving the Yogyakarta area on the island of Java, Indonesia. It was formerly the principal international airport serving this area. The airport is located in the Sleman Regency, in the Yogyakarta Special Region, on the north-east outskirts of the city, near the Prambanan historic temple site. The airport is approximately 6 kilometres (3.7 mi) from the city centre.

Adisutjipto Airport was once the fourth busiest airport in the region of Java–Bali, after Soekarno–Hatta International Airport (CGK) in Jakarta, Juanda International Airport (SUB) in Surabaya, and Ngurah Rai International Airport (DPS) in Bali. It has one runway, with dimensions of 2,200 metres (7,200 ft) by 45 metres (148 ft). The number of passengers flying through Adisucipto International Airport in Yogyakarta, throughout 2016 increased by approximately 13 percent compared to 2015. 7.2 million passengers were recorded in 2016 whereas in 2015, the number was 6.38 million. All jet-powered flights were relocated to the new international airport on 29 March 2020.

Adisutjipto Airport was preceded by a landing ground at Maguwo, which was used before and during the Second World War. The current airport is named after Agustinus Adisucipto, a pilot who was killed during an attack on Maguwo by the Dutch on 29 July 1947, when his flight, the Dakota VT-CLA, was shot down. Based on the decision of the head of the Air Force Staff No. 76 of 1952 on 17 August 1952, the name of Maguwo air base was changed to Adisutjipto airbase.

Since 1959, Adisutjipto Airport was made for the Republic of Indonesia Air Force Academy (AAU). In 1964, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation, with its decision and with the approval of the Indonesian Air Force, AdiSutjipto Jogjakarta Airport became a combined civil and military airport. In 1972, the first expansion of the civil air terminal was carried out. Then in 1977, the terminal was expanded again because of the increasing volume of flights. On 1 April 1992, in accordance with Government Regulation No. 48 of 1992, Adisutjipto Airport was officially entered into the management of Angkasa Pura I Corporation. On 2 January 1993, its status was changed to PT (PERSERO) Angkasa Pura I.

The airport was heavily damaged by the 2006 Yogyakarta earthquake, and had to be closed for two days. Some parts of the runway were cracked, and the departure lounge collapsed. Most flights were cancelled or rerouted to Adisumarmo International Airport, Solo. After the airport returned to service on 30 May 2006, all passengers used the international lounge until the new domestic departure lounge was ready. During this period, passenger comfort was affected as the international lounge was designed only for about 100 passengers at a time. The airport was closed for several days due to the 2010 Mount Merapi eruption, as the volcanic ash could endanger the safety of flights. During this period, passengers were diverted to Adisumarmo International Airport in Solo, Achmad Yani International Airport in Semarang, or transferred to another mode of transportation to the city of Yogyakarta.
